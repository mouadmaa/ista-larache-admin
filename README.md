## ISTA Larache

Developed a comprehensive web application for my school to streamline student and teacher interactions. The application provides a platform for students to register, check their acceptance status, view available classes, monitor their exam scores, and access their class schedules. It also includes a dedicated dashboard for teachers, enhancing their ability to manage classes and interact with students.

Technologies: React, Apollo, Graphql
